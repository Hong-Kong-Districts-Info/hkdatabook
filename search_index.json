What open data sets already exist out there about domain X? Who are the maintainers of open datasets or APIs in domain X? Of course, any subject with regard to domain X should relate to topics in Hong Kong. This project may seem an ambitious attempt in terms of scope, as there is plenty that is out there. However, the belief here is that crowd-sourcing would offer a solution here, as it has done for tremendously successful projects like Wikipedia, and generally other open-source communities like those for R and Python. 1.1 Contributing This is a collaborative book.

Our vision of Hong Kong Districts Info is to establish a learning and collaboration community to bring together people who are interested in: Learning and developing new skills, and Want real, impactful projects to work on Hong Kong Districts Info provides for such an environment where aspiring developers, artists, content creators, etc. can collaborate on Hong Kong district themed projects to establish their portfolio, promote their work, collaborate on open-source projects and make a positive impact. As the founders of this platform, we would participate in certain projects ourselves, but would also help connect and coordinate individuals so they can collaborate and publish work under our platform. If you are someone who is looking to build and expand their first coding, design, data science project, or website/app portfolio, and if you are looking to practice your skills on a meaningful, open-source project, you have come to the right place. From our base, we hope to provide mentoring to those who do not have the skills, but want to learn them.
