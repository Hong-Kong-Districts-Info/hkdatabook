# Demographics

Most demographic data is provided and collected by the Hong Kong Census and Statistics department. However, the raw data is not typically available, and _samples_ of the raw data have to be purchased. Summarised data, e.g. cross-tables, are available for download, but require some manipulation for them to be practical, as these aren't typically available in a [tidy](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html) format.
